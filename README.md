# The Go Programming Language

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software.

### This is a fork!

This is a fork of the Go compiler used for work on the rewrite of the [Scala 3](https://scala-lang.org/)
compiler in Go. The point of this fork is to add the single missing feature that has been
a major limitation for us - [Higher Kinded Types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). 
All the work is happening in the branch `introducing-higher-kinded-types`.
